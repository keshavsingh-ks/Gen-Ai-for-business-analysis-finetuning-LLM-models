# Fine-Tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo for Domain-Specific Tasks ðŸ’¡

(1.png)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of GPT-3.5 Turbo, a cutting-edge large language model (LLM) from OpenAI, to enhance its performance in handling specific tasks. Two models were created in this project: one fine-tuned for answering customer questions and another model specifically optimized for handling customer complaints. By utilizing real-world customer data, we created these two versions of GPT-3.5 Turbo to improve response accuracy and relevance in customer service scenarios.

This project highlights my expertise in Generative AI, fine-tuning techniques, and hyperparameter tuning to adapt models to niche requirements and improve overall performance in specific business use cases.

## Problem Statement

In customer service, handling complaints and answering customer inquiries effectively requires a model that understands the nuances of customer interactions. The goal of this project is to fine-tune GPT-3.5 Turbo to improve its ability to handle two key tasks:
1. **Answering customer questions**: Creating a model fine-tuned to provide accurate and helpful answers to frequently asked questions.
2. **Resolving customer complaints**: Optimizing a second model to handle customer complaints with increased accuracy and contextual understanding.

Fine-tuning allows us to customize the models' behavior to match real-world use cases, reduce the need for long prompts, lower token usage, and improve response timesâ€”crucial factors for scaling customer service operations.

## Key Features

- **Data Preparation**: Custom datasets based on real customer questions and complaints, converted into formats suitable for fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo.
  
- **Fine-Tuning Process**: Detailed fine-tuning process for both modelsâ€”one tailored for answering questions and the other for resolving complaintsâ€”optimized for domain-specific applications.

- **Model Customization**: Tailoring the models to improve their ability to handle nuanced queries with a focus on contextual understanding and providing relevant solutions.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusting model hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs, to fine-tune the model for better accuracy and performance.

- **Performance Comparison**: Evaluation of both fine-tuned models against the base GPT-3.5 Turbo, showcasing improvements in handling complex queries and customer complaints.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenAI API, Pandas, NumPy, dotenv
- **Data Formats**: JSON, CSV
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and hyperparameter tuning using OpenAIâ€™s fine-tuning API.


## Results

The fine-tuned models demonstrated marked improvements in handling customer inquiries and complaints:

- **Accuracy**: Increased ability to provide relevant solutions based on the specific context of customer queries and complaints.
- **Efficiency**: Reduced token usage due to shorter prompts and more contextually aware responses.
- **Response Time**: Improved latency, making the fine-tuned models more suitable for real-time customer service applications.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the power of fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo for domain-specific tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and overall performance. By customizing the models to handle both customer questions and complaints, we have created highly specialized AI tools suitable for real-world customer service applications.

Fine-tuning opens the door to highly tailored applications of large language models, allowing businesses to deploy AI solutions that meet their specific needs while optimizing operational efficiency.
